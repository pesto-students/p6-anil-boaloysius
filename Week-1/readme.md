When a user enters an URL in the browser, how does the browser fetch the desiredresult ? Explain this with the below in mind and Demonstrate this by drawing a diagramfor the same.(2-3hours)

a.What is the main functionality of the browser?

    The main functionality of a browser is to connect with the internet and display webpages.

b.High Level Components of a browser.

    1.User Interface
    It is an environment allowing users to use certain features like search bar, refresh button, menu, bookmarks, etc.

    2. Browser Engine
    The bridge connects the interface and the engine. It monitors the rendition engine while manipulating the inputs coming from multiple user interfaces.

    3. Networking
    The protocol provides an URL and manages all sorts of safety, privacy and communication.
    In addition, the store network traffic gets saved in retrieved documents.

    4. Data Storage
    The cookies store information as the data store is an uniform layer that the browsers use. Storage processes like IndexedDB, WebSQL, localStorage, etc works well on browsers.

    5. JavaScript Interpreter
    It allows conversion of JavaScript code in a document and the executes it. Then the engine shows the translation on the screen to the users.

c.Rendering engine and its use.

    The main responsibility of the rendering engine is to display the requested page on the browser screen. Rendering engines can display HTML and XML documents and images. If you're using additional plugins, the engines can also display different types of documents such as PDF.

d.Parsers (HTML, CSS, etc)

    They convert html and css code to low level languages and process using algorithms.

e.Script Processors

    The ScriptProcessorNode interface allows the generation, processing, or analyzing of audio using JavaScript.

f.Tree construction

    The DOM and CSSOM trees are combined to form the render tree. Render tree contains only the nodes required to render the page. - Layout computes the exact position and size of each object. - The last step is paint, which takes in the final render tree and renders the pixels to the screen
